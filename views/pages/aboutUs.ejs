                  <h2>About Yuliya</h2>
                  <p>I have 4+ years background in social media management, content marketing, and branding . Also I have degree in International law. About a year ago I realized I don’t really like what I do and I don’t see myself on this job in 5-10 years. I started researching for new opportunities where I can achieve a success and opened a world of Software Engineering for myself. I had no idea it would be so interesting for me, and now I feel myself in a right place.</p>
